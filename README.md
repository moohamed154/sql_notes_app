# sqlite_notetaking_app

This marks the third illustration in this tutorial series. In this instance, we uses **sqflite** to create a SQLite database (**notes.db**) and performs CRUD operations on it. The **NoteList** widget has been updated to load notes from the database during initialization and to use the database for adding, editing, and deleting notes. The code also includes dialogs for adding, editing, and deleting notes
